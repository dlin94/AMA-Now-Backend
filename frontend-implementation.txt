Front-End Basic Implementation (may be changed in production or later on)

1. We start at the main route '/'. There should be a link to the following URL:
https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=kPpo2pzRIdkrMw&response_type=code&state=randomstring&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:6500/submit&duration=permanent&scope=submit identity
(Make sure to change the redirect_uri appropriately.)

2. When the user authorizes the app, the browser should redirect to the route
'/submit' (set this in the app's redirect URI). The URL should have a query string
appended to it. In the ComponentWillMount() method (not sure), handle the query string,
saving it somewhere (maybe in the state).
See if we can redirect user to clean up the query string from URL (but not necessary).

3. Allow the user to choose type in and choose an AMA from the dropdown and
write his question. There will be a submit button. On submit, send a POST request
to the server consisting of the code from the query string, the AMA of interest,
and the question.

4. Write "Scheduled question to be asked." or something.
